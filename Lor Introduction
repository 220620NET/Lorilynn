Hi this is my personal introduction! My name is Lorelai. I am 31 years old
and double majored in music and philosophy. I enjoy learning new things and
being active both in and outside.

I'll also add today since I am remaking all these files that I specifically
play guitar and piano. I love doing digital art and 3d modeling. I am interested
in fully immersive virtual reality technology and Brain-Computer Interfaces.
